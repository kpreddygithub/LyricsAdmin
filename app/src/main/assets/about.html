FAQ
</h3>

<h4>Q. I couldn't find a song that I am looking for. What should I do?</h4>

</p>

<h4>
Q. I want to request a new feature. How do I go about that?
</h4>
<p>
The songs database and the app are maintained in separate Github projects. This is because the songs database is shared by both the Android and iOS version of Worship Songs. Worship Songs for Android lives at https://github.com/crunchersaspire/worshipsongs. You can request for a new feature by creating an issue there.

<h4>
Q. How do I report bugs?

<h4>
Q. Is there a way I can use these songs in my Church?
</h4>
<p>
Absolutely. In fact, the songs database that is shipped with this app is used by <a href="http://tmcsubangjaya.com"> Tamil Methodist Church Subang Jaya</a>. 
If you want to do that in your Church, you would need to install a software named OpenLP and replace it's default songs database with the one that ships with this app.
